My personal library I use for cloning, data access among other things.  The cloning functionality is based heavily off of CloneExtensions written by Marci Juraszek, which performs fast deep clones using simple assignment operations generated by expression tree runtime code compilation.  The data access works a set of extension methods and classes for use with the ADO.Net interface and is based off work by jhgbrt/yadal (yet another data access library).  Many changes I have made were to remove inefficiencies, to add or change functionality and to organize the code as my preferences dictate.  All of the work I have done to improve the original code base, I have offered back to any original author if they were interested in it.
